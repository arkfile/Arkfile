# Arkfile In-Depth Security Review — Executive Summary & Synthesis

Status: **Slice G complete** (2026-05-12). This is the consolidated executive synthesis for the multi-session adversarial security review of Arkfile defined in `docs/wip/review/00-plan.md` and driven by the prompt in `docs/wip/idsrp.md`. It draws **only** on the six analytical slice deliverables (`01-auth-opaque.md`, `02-crypto-keys.md`, `03-files-upload-download.md`, `04-sharing.md`, `05-api-authz-admin-billing.md`, `06-frontend-supply-ops.md`). No fresh source code was read for this document; every claim traces to a slice finding with a file:line citation already validated in that slice.

**Remediation update (2026-05-12):** Finding **F-01** (the Critical `X-Forwarded-For` localhost-gate bypass) has been **RESOLVED** in a commit-pending change set. See `docs/wip/review/06-frontend-supply-ops.md` §F-01 for the full remediation record. The cross-slice escalations that F-01 contributed to A-02, A-13, A-14, A-26, and E-14 are downgraded back to their per-slice baseline severities; each of those findings still requires its own per-finding fix and is tracked separately.

**Remediation update (2026-05-12, second tranche):** Finding **A-01** (the Critical "two-tier JWT model not enforced") has been **RESOLVED**, together with two ride-along findings **A-39** (Low: `RequiresTOTPFromToken` panic on missing claims) and **E-19** (High: public `ExportFile` accepts any valid Arkfile JWT without TOTP claim). See `docs/wip/review/01-auth-opaque.md` §A-01 for the full remediation record. Highlights:
- `auth/keys.go` now mints two distinct Ed25519 keypairs at first run: `jwt_signing_key_temp_v1` and `jwt_signing_key_full_v1`. The old single-key path is removed entirely (greenfield-policy clean break).
- `auth/jwt.go` `GenerateTemporaryTOTPToken` signs with the temp key (`aud=arkfile-totp`, `requires_totp=true`); `GenerateFullAccessToken` signs with the full key (`aud=arkfile-api`, `requires_totp=false`). The redundant `GenerateToken` function is deleted; `handlers/auth.go` `RefreshToken` calls `GenerateFullAccessToken`.
- `JWTMiddleware` and `TOTPJWTMiddleware` now route through `ParseTokenFunc` using `jwt.WithAudience(...)` to enforce the audience claim **and** validate against the per-tier public key. A temp token presented to a full-protected route fails on signature first and on audience second; either is sufficient.
- A new `auth.RequireFullJWT` middleware provides defense in depth: it rejects `claims.RequiresTOTP == true` and re-asserts the `arkfile-api` audience. It is wired onto `totpProtectedGroup`, `pendingAllowedGroup`, `adminGroup`, and `devTestAdminGroup` in `handlers/route_config.go`.
- `adminGroup` and `devTestAdminGroup` now include `RequireTOTP` in their middleware chain (closes the E-01 ride-along that was always present but unwired).
- `auth/token_revocation.go` `RevokeToken` accepts either tier (via a new `parseEitherTierToken` helper) so `/api/logout` and `/api/revoke-token` work for any session state.
- `handlers/export.go` rebuilds both auth resolution paths to enforce audience (`arkfile-export` for the token branch, `arkfile-api` for the JWT branch) and reject `requires_totp=true` -- closes **E-19**.
- `auth.RequiresTOTPFromToken` no longer panics on missing/malformed claims; returns `false` instead -- closes **A-39**.
- `monitoring/key_health.go` `checkJWTSigningKey` now queries the KeyManager for both new key IDs in the `system_keys` table instead of the stale file-based path.
- Frontend: a new `temp_token` localStorage slot keeps temp-tier credentials out of the full-tier `token` slot. `client/static/js/src/utils/auth.ts` exports `getTempToken`/`setTempToken`/`clearTempToken`; `login.ts`, `totp.ts`, `totp-setup.ts` route accordingly; `clearAllSessionData` purges all three slots. The spent temp token is cleared immediately after TOTP verify succeeds.
- 15 new Go tests across `auth/jwt_test.go` (audience cross-rejection, key cross-rejection, RequireFullJWT defense-in-depth, RequiresTOTPFromToken null-claim handling), `auth/token_revocation_test.go` (`TestRevokeToken_BothTiers`), and `handlers/admin_audience_test.go` (admin/totpProtected chain rejection of temp tokens and requires_totp=true tokens before any DB lookup). 7 new TS tests in `client/static/js/src/__tests__/auth-manager.test.ts` covering the temp-token slot and audience/requires_totp claim parsing.
- Full Go test suite (`go test ./...`) and full TS test suite (`bun test client/static/js/src/__tests__/`) green: 0 failures across all packages and 333 TS tests across 16 files.

The "Top 10 most serious risks" list, the "Remote-admin pathway" headline narrative, and the severity table below are unchanged from the original review for the audit trail; status markers are added inline where applicable.

Greenfield posture per `AGENTS.md`: Arkfile has no production deployments; `test.arkfile.net` is the only live beta. Severities in this document do not soften for "backwards compatibility"; the policy is fix-properly, not accommodate.

Per-finding evidence lives in the slice docs. This document carries the cross-slice synthesis: the headline risks where one root cause is visible across multiple slices, the consolidated index, the merged tables, and explicit answers to every question in `idsrp.md` §19.

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Overall security posture

Arkfile's documented design — OPAQUE for password-authenticated key exchange, client-side AEAD for file content, Argon2id-derived KEKs that wrap per-file random FEKs, password-derived share envelopes, no PII / no IP logging — is sound and modern. The primitives chosen (libopaque/liboprf/libsodium for OPAQUE; AES-256-GCM via Web Crypto and Go's `crypto/aes`; Argon2id; Ed25519 JWT signatures; SHA-256-keyed HMAC EntityID) are appropriate. Where the design is correctly implemented, it delivers what it claims.

However, the **implementation does not yet meet the design's claims** in several places that matter materially for the threat model. The review surfaced **179 findings** across the six slices (2 Critical, 27 High, 61 Medium, 52 Low, 37 Informational; see §4 for the consolidated index). Of those, four cross-slice patterns dominate the risk picture:

1. **The two-tier JWT model is not enforced** (Slice A `A-01`). The post-OPAQUE temp token is intended to be valid only at `/api/totp/{setup,verify,auth}`; the validator does not check `aud` or `requires_totp`, both tokens are signed with the same Ed25519 key, and `RequireTOTP` only consults a DB flag that every TOTP-enrolled user has. The "second factor" is therefore cosmetic at the protocol level: anyone who completes OPAQUE alone reaches every protected route.

2. **Localhost-only protections are bypassable from anywhere on the internet** (Slice F `F-01`, Critical) — **RESOLVED 2026-05-12**. The Echo `c.RealIP()` default walked attacker-controlled `X-Forwarded-For`; `main.go` did not override `e.IPExtractor`; `Caddyfile.prod` and `Caddyfile.test` did not strip the incoming header. `AdminMiddleware`'s localhost gate and the admin-bootstrap localhost gate both trusted `c.RealIP()` for authorization. This single defect escalated four Slice A findings (A-02, A-13, A-14, A-26) and one Slice E finding (E-14) into a remotely-reachable admin and bootstrap-redemption attack surface. Closed in commit-pending change set: `main.go` now pins `e.IPExtractor = echo.ExtractIPDirect()`, `handlers/middleware.go` introduces `peerAddrIsLoopback` and `publicClientIP` helpers used by `AdminMiddleware` / `RateLimitMiddleware` / `RequireTOTP` / `handlers/bootstrap.go`, `logging/entity_id.go` prefers a Caddy-set `X-Arkfile-Peer` header for EntityID binning, and all four Caddyfiles strip `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP` / `Forwarded` and set `X-Arkfile-Peer`. 11 regression tests in `handlers/middleware_test.go` and `handlers/bootstrap_test.go` cover the gate; full handlers / logging / auth / crypto / billing / models / config / utils / storage test suites green. See `06-frontend-supply-ops.md` §F-01.

3. **Authenticated-encryption integrity does not bind cryptographically to file identity or chunk order** (Slice B `B-02` / `B-05` / `B-08`, Slice C `C-02` / `C-03` / `C-19`). No file-chunk, FEK envelope, or metadata encryption operation uses AAD. The server (or any party with DB write access) can swap encrypted chunks between two of the same user's files, reorder chunks within a file, or substitute one user's FEK envelope for another. The end-of-file plaintext SHA-256 verification (Slice C `C-13`/`C-14`) detects content-level swap but only after the file has been written to disk; the warning is post-facto and the Blob fallback path skips verification entirely. The claimed file-identity integrity is not provided.

4. **Server-side parameters that should be client-side floors are downloaded over an unauthenticated channel** (Slice B `B-01` / `B-03` / `B-19`). Argon2id parameters, chunking parameters, and password requirements are fetched at runtime from `/api/config/*` with no signature or pinning. A compromised server can silently weaken every future KDF derivation, every chunk size, and every password check. The same defect makes shared envelopes brute-forceable offline if a server operator obtains the envelope blob (Slice D `D-10`): the Argon2id parameters are not bound into the envelope, so the operator picks the cheapest parameters the client will accept.

A fifth pattern — credential material at rest — pulls together a coherent set of medium-severity findings that, taken together, mean a server-side compromise of `system_keys` + the DB recovers cleartext TOTP secrets and cleartext backup codes for every user (Slice A `A-07` + `A-17` + `A-18`).

The system is **not** broken end-to-end. Content confidentiality of file payloads against the server is **substantially** achieved: a server that follows protocol cannot read file plaintext, and a passive server-side observer learns roughly the padded-blob size, the timing of uploads, and the username — but not file content. The gaps above raise the bar for an *active* server that can swap, reorder, or substitute artifacts, and for an attacker who reaches the admin surface via `F-01` or `A-01`.

### 1.2 Most serious risks (top ten)

In priority order. Each entry cites the underlying slice finding(s) and the cross-slice escalation that elevates it above the per-slice severity.

1. **(Critical) `F-01` — `X-Forwarded-For` localhost-gate bypass — RESOLVED 2026-05-12.** Slice F. Escalated `A-02` (admin temp-token reach), `A-13` (bootstrap window), `A-14` (dev-test API in prod), `A-26` (bootstrap token in stdout), and `E-14` (admin middleware trusts header) into one cohesive remote-admin pathway. Fix landed: pinned `e.IPExtractor = echo.ExtractIPDirect()` in `main.go`; introduced `peerAddrIsLoopback` (kernel transport peer, authz-only) and `publicClientIP` (Caddy-set `X-Arkfile-Peer` header, EntityID/rate-limit-only) helpers in `handlers/middleware.go`; refactored `AdminMiddleware`, `RateLimitMiddleware`, `RequireTOTP`, and both bootstrap handlers; updated `logging/entity_id.go` to prefer `X-Arkfile-Peer`; added `header_up -X-Forwarded-For` / `-X-Real-IP` / `-Forwarded` and `header_up X-Arkfile-Peer {http.request.remote.host}` to all four Caddyfile variants. 11 regression tests added. Cross-slice items A-02, A-13, A-14, A-26, E-14 revert to their per-slice baselines and are tracked individually.
2. **(Critical) `A-01` — two-tier JWT model not enforced.** Slice A. The validator does not check `aud` or `requires_totp`; both tiers use the same Ed25519 key. Combined with `F-01`, completing OPAQUE alone yields full access to every protected route, including admin. Fix: enforce audience claim at `echojwt.ParseTokenFunc`; reject `requires_totp=true` at every protected group; use separate signing keys per tier.
3. **(High, escalates with F-01) `F-03` — bootstrap token harvested from systemd journal.** With `F-01` allowing remote redemption and `A-13` keeping the token alive after the first registration, anyone with `journalctl` access on the host (root, ops staff, container shell) can seed a second admin remotely. Fix: stop logging the token; consume on first redemption.
4. **(High) `A-07` + `A-17` + `A-18` — TOTP backup codes encrypted, not hashed; master key co-located with every other server secret.** A `system_keys` + DB compromise yields plaintext TOTP backup codes for every user with zero offline cost. The TOTP master key is not `mlock`'d, not `MADV_DONTDUMP`'d, and is in the same table as the JWT signing key, the OPAQUE server private key, and the bootstrap token. Fix: store backup codes as per-code Argon2id hashes; move TOTP master to a separate at-rest store with rotation.
5. **(High) `A-05` + `F-07` — JWTs (temp and full) and refresh token in `localStorage`.** Any XSS, dependency compromise, or browser-extension reach yields full session takeover, and combined with `A-04` / `F-08` (plaintext password on `window.totpLoginData`) yields the password itself. Fix: move tokens to `__Host-` `HttpOnly` cookies with CSRF protection.
6. **(High) `B-02` + `B-05` + `B-08` + `C-02` + `C-03` + `C-19` — no AAD on file chunks, FEK envelope, or metadata.** A server with write access to the DB or storage can swap chunks within or between a user's files; the byte-range math trusts DB-stored `chunk_size_bytes`/`chunk_count`; the `models/file.go` doc claims AAD that the upload pipeline does not apply. End-of-file SHA-256 detects but only post-disk-write. Fix: bind `file_id`, chunk-index, and field-name into AAD for every file-related AEAD operation in both Go (`crypto/file_operations.go`, CLI) and TS (`crypto/upload.ts`, `streaming-download.ts`); fail at AEAD layer, not at end-of-file hash.
7. **(High) `B-01` + `B-03` + `B-19` + `D-10` + `D-12` — server-controlled crypto parameters.** Argon2id params, chunk params, password requirements are runtime-fetched from `/api/config/*` with no signature/binding. A compromised server silently downgrades every future encryption, password check, and share envelope. Stolen share envelopes are then brute-forceable offline at the weakest accepted params. Fix: embed parameter *floors* in client bundles; bind KDF params into share envelopes; refuse server-supplied params below floor.
8. **(High) `E-02` — SQL injection in `AdminSyncStatus` via interpolated `provider_id`.** Admin-authenticated only, but combined with `F-01` (remote-reachable admin) and `A-01` (temp token alone suffices), the precondition is no longer "trusted local admin". Fix: parameterized SQL; add a `golangci-lint` rule banning `fmt.Sprintf` adjacent to SQL keywords.
9. **(High, future-Critical) `E-21` + `E-03` + `E-04` + `E-05` — financial-audit integrity gaps.** `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `users(username)` wipes `credit_transactions` and `admin_logs` when a user is deleted; `settleOneUser` reads `user_credits.balance` outside the transaction; no UNIQUE constraint on `credit_transactions(transaction_id)`; process-local `lastSweepDate` allows duplicate sweeps on restart. Today these are billing-correctness defects; the moment a payment processor (Stripe, crypto, ACH, SEPA) is wired in, every one becomes Critical. Fix: soft-delete users; `UNIQUE(transaction_id)`; persistent `lastSweepDate`; tx-scoped reads.
10. **(High) `F-04` + `F-05` + `F-06` + `F-13` — supply-chain integrity gaps.** WASM `libopaque.js` served without SRI; Go binaries built without `-trimpath`/`-buildid=`/`-ldflags='-s -w'`/`-buildvcs=false` and no release signing; libsodium pulled from host apt/dnf rather than vendored submodule; `bun install` without `--frozen-lockfile`. Combined: an attacker who reaches the build host or the asset CDN can substitute crypto code with no integrity check downstream. Fix: SRI on every shipped asset; reproducible build flags; vendored libsodium; frozen lockfile; cosign-signed releases.

### 1.3 Whether cryptographic claims appear justified

`AGENTS.md` makes four cryptographic claims explicitly or by strong implication:

| Claim | Status | Caveat |
|---|---|---|
| OPAQUE is used and the password is never sent to the server | **Yes** | The browser does keep the plaintext password in `window.totpLoginData` during the TOTP-handoff window (`A-04`/`F-08`). The OPAQUE protocol itself does not leak the password; the *frontend integration* does, transiently. |
| Files are encrypted client-side before reaching the server | **Yes** | Content confidentiality is achieved. The server never sees plaintext file bytes. |
| File metadata (filename, size, original SHA-256) is encrypted | **Partial** | Filename and SHA-256 are encrypted under the Account-KEK (`B-07` notes that the same key wraps FEKs *and* encrypts metadata — domain-separation omission). **File size is not** end-to-end encrypted: the server learns the unpadded size before applying padding (`B-06`), and the padded size leaks ~2.2% of plaintext size to anyone with bucket access. Chunk count is plaintext (`D-21`). |
| No PII / no IP logging | **Mostly** | EntityID HMAC is correctly implemented. But `InfoLogger` lines in the upload/download path log username and file_id together (`C-15`), share creation logs the owner's username (`D-25`), the admin audit-log `details` column contains operator-supplied strings that can include sensitive inputs (`E-15`), `LogUserAction` records plaintext file_id, and `DEBUG_MODE=true` (enabled by `dev-reset.sh`) prints raw refresh tokens (`A-11`). The privacy posture is consistent in design but leaks in implementation. |

### 1.4 Whether file confidentiality from the server is actually achieved

**Yes for content; partial for metadata; partial for integrity.**

- **Content (file bytes).** Yes. AES-256-GCM with random per-chunk nonces under a random per-file FEK that is wrapped by an Argon2id-derived KEK held only client-side. A protocol-following server never sees plaintext. (Slice B §1.2.)
- **Metadata.** Filename, plaintext SHA-256, and the FEK itself are encrypted. File size is leaked to within ~10% via server-applied padding (`B-06`). Owner username, upload timestamp, chunk count, chunk size, storage-provider routing, and password hint are all server-visible by design. (Slice B §3.3, Slice C §3.3, Slice D §3.3.)
- **Integrity.** AEAD tag verification is performed on every decrypt. **However**, no AAD binds chunks to file or order (`B-02`/`B-05`/`C-02`), and the server-trusted byte-range math (`C-03`) means an active server can reorder or substitute chunks within the user's own file space. The end-of-file plaintext SHA-256 check catches content-level tampering but only after disk write (`C-13`), and the Blob fallback path skips it entirely (`C-14`). The claim "content authenticity against an active server" is therefore **not yet achieved**; the system relies on end-of-file SHA-256 as a second-tier integrity check, which is post-disk-write.

### 1.5 Top recommended fixes (consolidated, in landing order)

This is the order in which a fix campaign would have maximum risk-reduction per developer-hour. Each fix maps to one or more slice findings.

1. **Set `e.IPExtractor` to localhost-only, strip XFF at Caddy, and rebase admin/bootstrap authz on the kernel transport peer.** **DONE 2026-05-12.** Closed `F-01` and downgraded `A-02`/`A-13`/`A-14`/`A-26`/`E-14` to their per-slice baselines. Landed as `main.go` `e.IPExtractor = echo.ExtractIPDirect()` plus `peerAddrIsLoopback` / `publicClientIP` helpers in `handlers/middleware.go`, `handlers/bootstrap.go` rebase, `logging/entity_id.go` X-Arkfile-Peer support, all four Caddyfile variants updated, 11 regression tests added.
2. **Enforce JWT audience and `requires_totp` claims at the validator.** Add `echojwt.ParseTokenFunc` rejection of wrong-aud and `requires_totp=true` on every protected group. Mint temp and full tokens with distinct Ed25519 keys (`jwt_signing_key_temp_v1`, `jwt_signing_key_full_v1`). Closes `A-01` and structurally protects against future audience-claim oversight. Add `RequireFullJWT` as defense-in-depth on `totpProtectedGroup`, `adminGroup`, and `pendingAllowedGroup`.
3. **Move auth tokens out of `localStorage` into `__Host-` `HttpOnly` `SameSite=Strict` cookies; add CSRF double-submit.** Stop storing the plaintext password on `window.totpLoginData`. Closes `A-04`/`A-05`/`F-07`/`F-08` and reduces the blast radius of any frontend compromise.
4. **Bind AAD to every file-related AEAD operation.** Chunk encrypt/decrypt: AAD = `file_id || chunk_index || chunk_count || ciphertext_sha256`. FEK envelope: AAD = `file_id || key_type`. Metadata fields: AAD = `file_id || field_name || owner_username`. Mirror in both Go (`crypto/file_operations.go`, CLI) and TS (`crypto/upload.ts`, `streaming-download.ts`). Bump the envelope version byte to `0x02` and reject unknown versions. Closes `B-02`/`B-05`/`B-08`/`C-02`/`C-03`/`C-19`.
5. **Bind Argon2id parameters into the share envelope; ship parameter floors in client bundles.** Embed `crypto/argon2id-params.json`, `crypto/chunking-params.json`, and `crypto/password-requirements.json` as compile-time constants in the TS bundle and the Go binaries; treat `/api/config/*` as informational only. Bind the actual KDF parameters used into the share envelope so a downgrade is detectable on decrypt. Closes `B-01`/`B-03`/`B-19`/`D-10`/`D-12`.
6. **Replace TOTP-backup-code AES-GCM blob with per-code Argon2id hashes + `UNIQUE(username, code_hash)` constraints**; `mlock`+`MADV_DONTDUMP`+`PR_SET_DUMPABLE=0` on the TOTP master key page; move TOTP master out of `system_keys` into a separately-stored on-disk file with rotation. Closes `A-07`/`A-16`/`A-17`/`A-18`.
7. **Schema-level financial-audit integrity.** Soft-delete users (`deleted_at TIMESTAMP`) rather than `DELETE FROM users`; add `UNIQUE(transaction_id)` on `credit_transactions`; persist `last_sweep_date` across restarts; move the read-of-balance inside the settlement transaction. Add CHECK constraints on `transaction_type` and `provider_id`. Closes `E-03`/`E-04`/`E-05`/`E-21`/`E-22`/`E-23`. Pre-requisite for any payment-processor work.
8. **Build-and-ship integrity.** Add `-trimpath`/`-buildid=`/`-ldflags='-s -w'`/`-buildvcs=false` to all three Go binaries; vendor libsodium as a pinned git submodule; run `bun install --frozen-lockfile`; emit SRI hashes for `libopaque.js` and `dist/app.js` at build time and embed them in the HTML; sign release artifacts with cosign or minisign; emit an SBOM. Closes `F-04`/`F-05`/`F-06`/`F-13`/`F-25`.
9. **Per-user TOTP failure lockout** keyed on username, not on EntityID. Add `consecutive_totp_failures`/`last_failed_attempt` to `user_totp`; lock after 10 failures; emit security event. Closes `A-08`.
10. **Per-request user-wide JWT revocation enforcement.** Add `IsUserJWTRevoked` to `TokenRevocationMiddleware`; replace `uuid.New().String()` with 256-bit `auth.GenerateRefreshToken()`; add reuse detection that revokes the entire refresh-token family on detected replay. Closes `A-09`/`A-10`.

The 10 items above resolve 1 Critical, 12 High, and ~20 Medium findings. Everything else in §4 is addressable but lower-leverage.

Key facts that drive cross-slice risks:
- The validator does not check `aud` or `requires_totp` (`A-01`).
- `c.RealIP()` is attacker-controlled (`F-01`).
- Admin group has no `RequireTOTP` (`E-01`).
- 51 of 64 admin/billing endpoints are not route-level TOTP-gated (Slice E §3.1).

```

Cross-slice notes: every issued JWT today is signed with the same Ed25519 key (`A-01`); the temp token is structurally indistinguishable from the full token at the validator; the password is held on `window.totpLoginData` from OPAQUE finalize through TOTP verify (`A-04`); the Account-KEK is derived using server-supplied Argon2id parameters (`B-01`/`B-19`).

### 2.3 Login flow

Identical to §2.2 from `POST /api/opaque/login/response` onward, except no TOTP-setup step — the user enters an existing TOTP code at `POST /api/totp/auth`. Admin login replaces `/api/opaque/login/*` with `/api/admin/login/*`, which enforces `user.IsAdmin` before responding (Slice A §1.1). Account enumeration is possible at both login paths via HTTP-status differential (`A-24`) and admin enumeration via `/api/admin/login/response` (`A-24`).

CLI login (`arkfile-client login`) follows the same OPAQUE handshake using shared `auth/opaque_client.go`, prompts for TOTP code or accepts `--totp-secret` (`A-06` — argv leak), derives Account-KEK via `crypto.DeriveAccountPasswordKey`, and optionally hands the KEK to a local key-agent daemon over `~/.arkfile/agent-<uid>.sock` (`A-21` — same-UID processes can drain the cache). Admin login (`arkfile-admin login`) is structurally identical but returns a `string` password instead of `[]byte`, leaving the password unzeroizable in heap memory (`A-03`).

```

Cross-slice: the share envelope is the **only** AEAD operation in Arkfile that uses AAD (Slice B §1.3). But the share KDF parameters are not bound into the envelope (`D-12`), and an operator who exfiltrates a stored envelope can brute-force the share password offline at the weakest accepted Argon2id params (`D-10` × `B-19`).

### 2.7 Password change / recovery — there isn't one

Per `AGENTS.md` and Slice A N/A items, there is **no password change**, **no password reset**, **no email verification**, **no "forgot password" flow**, and **no admin reset for TOTP**. The intended posture is "lost password = lost files; lost authenticator = lost account". TOTP backup codes exist but `/api/totp/reset` requires a full JWT (which requires TOTP), so a user who has lost their authenticator cannot use a backup code to recover (`A-15`). The recovery model is consistent with the no-PII privacy stance but is not documented user-facing, and the backup-code mechanism is therefore not reachable for its intended use case.

## 3. Threat-Model Assessment vs. `idsrp.md` §2

The `idsrp.md` threat model lists 13 adversary classes and ~13 security properties. The matrix below maps the implementation today against each.

### 3.1 Adversaries — coverage

| Adversary | Posture today | Key gaps | Slice refs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Remote unauthenticated attacker | **Mostly good**; one Critical bypass | `F-01` lets a remote attacker pretend to be loopback; with a leaked bootstrap token or stolen admin JWT, full admin surface is reachable | `F-01`, `F-03`, `A-13`, `A-26` |
| Remote authenticated malicious user | Adequate | Account-enumeration `A-24`/`A-25`; share-enumeration in-memory only `D-18`; max_accesses bypass on shared files `D-01`; access_count race `D-02` | `A-24/A-25`, `D-01/D-02/D-18` |
| Malicious file recipient | Reasonable | `D-13`: revocation is future-fetch-only and the UI overstates the guarantee; `D-26`: owner-controlled envelope plaintext metadata is a tracking channel | `D-13`, `D-26` |
| Compromised user account | Adequate but slow to revoke | `A-09`: user-wide JWT revocation not enforced per-request; `A-10`: refresh tokens are 122-bit UUIDs with no reuse-detection | `A-09`, `A-10` |
| Compromised browser environment | **Significant gaps** | Plaintext password on `window.totpLoginData` (`A-04`/`F-08`); JWT + refresh token in localStorage (`A-05`/`F-07`); ~12 `innerHTML` sinks without Trusted Types (`F-17`) | A-04/A-05/A-22, F-07/F-08/F-17 |
| Network attacker | Good | Caddy TLS 1.3, HSTS, deSEC DNS-01; loopback-only Arkfile listener (with `F-01` exception). Internal Caddy→Arkfile TLS is `tls_insecure_skip_verify` but loopback-only (`F-18`) | F-18 |
| Malicious or compromised server operator | **Partially broken** | No AAD binds chunks/FEK/metadata to file identity (`B-02`/`B-08`/`C-02`/`C-19`); server picks Argon2id parameters runtime (`B-01`/`B-19`); operator can offline-brute-force stolen share envelopes (`D-10`) | B-01/B-02/B-08/B-19, C-02/C-03/C-19, D-10/D-12 |
| Database compromise attacker | Adequate but `system_keys`-dependent | If DB only: OPAQUE design protects passwords; share envelopes are offline-attackable at server-set params. If DB + ARKFILE_MASTER_KEY + system_keys: every server-side key + every TOTP backup code in cleartext (`A-07`/`A-18`/`B-16`) | A-07/A-17/A-18, B-16 |
| Object-storage compromise attacker | Mostly good; metadata gaps | Encrypted chunks; but storage objects include `owner-username` in user metadata (`C-09`), padded size leaks ~2.2% of plaintext size (`B-06`) | C-09, B-06 |
| Supply-chain attacker (npm / Go modules / WASM / CGO / build) | **Significant gaps** | No SRI on `libopaque.js` (`F-04`); Go binaries built without `-trimpath`/`-buildid=` (`F-05`); libsodium from host apt/dnf (`F-06`); `bun install` without `--frozen-lockfile` (`F-13`); no release signing or SBOM (`F-25`); rqlite unpinned (`F-12`); SeaweedFS pinned via MD5 (`F-11`) | F-04/F-05/F-06/F-11/F-12/F-13/F-25 |
| Cross-site scripting attacker | Partially mitigated | CSP forbids `'unsafe-inline'` for `script-src` (correct); ~12 `innerHTML` sinks (`F-17`); no Trusted Types; full JWT + plaintext password reachable via XSS (`A-04/A-05/F-07/F-08`) | F-14/F-17, A-04/A-05 |
| Cross-site request forgery attacker | Adequate by design (tokens not in cookies) | `D-27`: anonymous share GET endpoints lack explicit Origin check; `D-09`: share-URL Origin trust | D-09, D-27 |
| Insider with access to logs, metrics, storage, snapshots | Mostly good; specific log leaks | `A-11`: refresh tokens logged when `DEBUG_MODE=true`; `C-15`/`D-15`/`D-25`: plaintext username + file_id at INFO; `E-15`: operator strings in `admin_logs.details`; `F-03`: bootstrap token in systemd journal | A-11, C-15, D-15/D-25, E-15, F-03 |

### 3.2 Security properties — pass/partial/fail

| Property | Status | Justification + slice ref |
|---|---|---|
| Password confidentiality | **Partial** | OPAQUE protocol meets the bar. Browser holds plaintext password on `window.totpLoginData` from OPAQUE-finalize through TOTP-verify (`A-04`/`F-08`). CLI `arkfile-admin` returns the password as a Go `string` that cannot be zeroed (`A-03`). |
| Resistance to offline password guessing | **Partial** | OPAQUE prevents this for login-passwords against a DB-only attacker. Argon2id-with-deterministic-salt (account/custom) is fine because the salt is only an input to a slow KDF, but Argon2id parameters are server-controlled (`B-01`/`B-19`) — a compromised server lowers the bar. Share passwords are fully offline-attackable on stolen envelopes (`D-10`). |
| OPAQUE protocol correctness | **Mostly OK** | libopaque is trusted upstream; CGO wrapper line-by-line audited (`auth/opaque_wrapper.c`). Issues: OPAQUE server public key independently generated rather than derived (`A-27`); idS hardcoded as `"server"` rather than deployment FQDN (`A-28`); CGO password-buffer not zeroed in C heap (`A-38`); CGO double-buffer pattern internally inconsistent in `StoreUserRecord` (`A-36`). |
| File content confidentiality against server | **Pass** | AES-256-GCM under random per-file FEK; FEK never reaches server unwrapped. (Slice B §1.2.) |
| File integrity and authenticity | **Partial / Fail** | AEAD tags protect against random tampering. No AAD binds chunks to file identity or order — server-side reordering / inter-file swap is undetectable at the AEAD layer (`B-02`/`B-05`/`C-02`/`C-03`). End-of-file plaintext SHA-256 catches content-level tampering but only post-disk-write (`C-13`); Blob fallback skips this entirely (`C-14`). |
| Authorization for reads / writes / deletes / shares / revocations | **Partial** | Per-route ownership checks are mostly correct. Gaps: `C-12` `/envelope` skips `IsApproved`; `C-05` `CancelUpload` route is dead-on-arrival (param mismatch); admin group not TOTP-gated (`E-01`); `ExportFile` accepts any valid Arkfile JWT without TOTP claim (`E-19`); `AdminExportFile` lets any admin download any blob (`E-20`). |
| Recipient-only access for shared files | **Partial** | Anyone with URL + password can access — by design. `D-01`/`D-02` allow `max_accesses` bypass and double-spend. |
| Revocation semantics | **Future-access only, mis-marketed** | Revoking a share prevents future fetches of envelope + chunks. Anyone who already decrypted the envelope holds the FEK forever; the file is not re-encrypted on revoke. UI says "immediately prevent anyone from accessing" (`D-13`) which is stronger than the implementation. |
| Metadata confidentiality, if claimed | **Partial** | Filename + plaintext SHA-256 encrypted client-side. Size leaks within ~10% via padding (`B-06`). Owner username, upload timestamp, chunk count, chunk size, storage routing, password hint, share file_id ↔ share_id mapping all plaintext at server. |
| Resistance to replay / rollback / substitution / confused-deputy | **Fail at AEAD layer** | No AAD binds file_id, chunk index, key-type, owner. Active server can substitute and reorder undetected at AEAD layer; relies on end-of-file SHA-256 (`B-02`/`C-02`/`C-19`). |
| Secure key rotation and password change | **N/A by design** | No password change. No TOTP-master rotation script. JWT key rotation script exists but `F-19` flags it as stale. (`A-18`/`F-19`.) |
| Safe recovery flows | **N/A by design, but inconsistent** | No password reset (intentional). TOTP backup-code recovery path is unreachable from a lost-device state (`A-15`); backup codes are encrypted-not-hashed on the server (`A-07`). The user feature exists but the flow does not work. |

### 4.6 Cross-slice headline risks

These are not new findings; they collapse multiple findings into a single risk narrative.

| Headline | Underlying findings | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Remote-admin pathway** | F-01 (Critical) escalating A-02, A-13, A-14, A-26, E-01, E-02, E-12, E-14, E-18, E-19 | One Echo config line + one Caddy block keep an admin attack out of reach. Without them, every Slice E admin-side finding becomes remotely exploitable. |
| **TOTP-as-decoration** | A-01 (Critical) compounded by A-02, A-08, E-01, F-01 | Validator does not check `aud` or `requires_totp`; admin group has no `RequireTOTP`; no per-user lockout. The "mandatory 2FA" claim does not hold at the JWT layer. |
| **File-identity authenticity gap** | B-02, B-05, B-08, C-02, C-03, C-19 | No AAD anywhere on the file path. End-of-file SHA-256 catches content tampering only post-disk-write; AEAD layer detects nothing. Single coordinated fix (bind file_id + chunk_index + key_type into AAD everywhere) closes all six. |
| **Server-controlled crypto parameters** | B-01, B-03, B-19, D-10, D-12 | Three runtime-fetched config endpoints + one un-bound share envelope. A compromised server can silently downgrade every future KDF and every shared-envelope brute-force. |
| **Frontend credential exposure** | A-04, A-05, F-07, F-08, F-17 | Tokens in localStorage + plaintext password on `window.totpLoginData` + 12 `innerHTML` sinks without Trusted Types. Any XSS, dep compromise, or browser-extension hit yields password + session. |
| **Server-secret single-point-of-compromise** | A-07, A-17, A-18, B-16 | All system keys + TOTP master key in one `system_keys` table; backup codes encrypted not hashed; ARKFILE_MASTER_KEY is a single env var. DB + system_keys + master key = full plaintext recovery of TOTP secrets and backup codes for every user. |
| **Financial-audit-integrity gap (future-Critical)** | E-03, E-04, E-05, E-21, E-22 | Today these are billing-correctness defects; once Stripe/crypto/ACH is wired in, every one is Critical for chargeback evidence, refund audit, and double-spend safety. Fix before any payment-processor integration lands. |
| **Supply-chain integrity gap** | F-04, F-05, F-06, F-11, F-12, F-13, F-25 | WASM no SRI + Go binaries no `-trimpath`/signing + libsodium from host + rqlite unpinned + SeaweedFS MD5 + bun not frozen + no SBOM/audit. Each individually small; collectively the build is not verifiable and the assets are not pinned. |
| **Recovery-flow inconsistency** | A-07, A-15, A-16, A-42 | Backup codes are advertised as the lost-device recovery path; the recovery endpoint is unreachable from a lost-device state; codes are encrypted not hashed; codes have modulo bias and tests log them plaintext. The user feature exists but does not work for its intended use case. |
| **Privacy-posture leakage in logs** | A-11, C-15, C-26, D-15, D-25, E-15, F-03 | The "no IP / no PII" privacy posture is consistently designed (EntityID HMAC), but `InfoLogger` lines log plaintext username + file_id (C-15/D-15/D-25), `DEBUG_MODE=true` prints raw refresh tokens (A-11), admin audit details contain operator inputs (E-15), and bootstrap token is in journald (F-03). |

| `GET /api/admin/alerts/summary` | E-01 |
| `GET /api/admin/billing/price`, `POST /api/admin/billing/set-price`, `GET /api/admin/billing/sweep-summary`, `GET /api/admin/billing/overdrawn`, `POST /api/admin/billing/gift` | E-01, **E-04 no idempotency**, E-06 overflow, E-15 details cleartext |
| `POST /api/admin/dev-test/users/cleanup`, `GET /api/admin/dev-test/totp/decrypt-check/:u`, `POST /api/admin/dev-test/billing/tick-now` | E-11, **E-12** TOTP oracle, **A-14** no production-env check |

**Count summary**: of 64 admin/billing/misc/auth endpoints reviewed at the API layer, **51 are NOT route-level TOTP-gated** per `idsrp.md` §22.3. Fixing E-01 (add `RequireTOTP` to `adminGroup`) closes this in one line.

| Share salt | 256 | crypto/rand per share | OK |
| FEK | 256 | crypto/rand per file | OK |
| Per-chunk nonce | 96 | crypto/rand per chunk | OK; never reused under a single FEK |
| Download token | 256 | crypto/rand per share | OK; SHA-256-hashed at rest |

## 8. Metadata Exposure Matrix (merged B + C + D)

`Server-visible` = visible to the Go process. `Storage-visible` = visible to S3 backend (object metadata or object body). `Encrypted` / `Authenticated` apply to the values stored, not to network in-transit.

| Metadata item | Server-visible? | Storage-visible? | Encrypted at rest? | Authenticated (AAD)? | Notes / slice refs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Filename (plaintext) | No (ciphertext only) | No | Yes (Account-KEK) | **No** (`B-07`, `C-19`) | Doc claims AAD; code does not bind |
| File extension (separate metadata) | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | Not stored separately |
| Plaintext SHA-256 hex | No | No | Yes (Account-KEK) | **No** | |
| Encrypted-file SHA-256 (server-computed) | **Yes** | No (DB only) | No | n/a | By design — anti-equivocation record |
| Stored blob SHA-256 | **Yes** | No | No | n/a | Includes padding |
| MIME type | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | Not stored; HTTP layer always returns `application/octet-stream` (Slice C §4) |

| Padded size | **Yes** | Yes (S3 object's actual byte length) | No | n/a | Leaks ~2.2% of plaintext size |
| Upload timestamp | **Yes** | Yes (S3 `LastModified`) | No | n/a | Standard DB timestamps |
| Modified timestamp | **Yes** | Yes | No | n/a | |
| Owner username | **Yes** | **Yes** (in S3 user metadata — `C-09`) | No | n/a | Required for ACL/KEK; storage leak avoidable |
| Recipient identity (sharing) | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | **No PII; EntityID HMAC only** (`D-11`, `D-19`) |
| Folder path | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | No folders (flat per-user) |
| Number of files per user | **Yes** | n/a | No | n/a | Trivially queryable |
| Chunk count | **Yes** | No | No | **No** (`C-03`) | Used in byte-range math |
| Chunk size | **Yes** | No | No | **No** (`C-03`) | |
| Per-chunk byte ranges | **Yes** (derivable) | n/a | No | **No** | |

| Password hint | **Yes** (cleartext by design) | No | No | n/a | By design |
| Password type byte | **Yes** | No | No | n/a | |
| Access frequency | **Yes** (logs) | n/a | No | n/a | `C-15` logs file_id + username |
| Sharing graph (owner → recipient) | partial | n/a | n/a | n/a | No recipient identity; owner ↔ share_id mapping is plaintext |
| Share password | only to recipient | n/a | n/a | n/a | Never sent to server |
| Share salt | yes (envelope response) | n/a | No (plaintext in DB) | n/a | Required for KDF |
| Argon2id params (for share) | yes (via `/api/config/argon2`) | n/a | No | **No (not bound)** | `D-12` |
| Encrypted envelope blob | yes (to recipient + server) | n/a | Yes (AES-GCM-AAD) | Yes | Asset under offline attack `D-10` |
| Share download token | only to recipient post-decrypt | n/a | inside envelope (encrypted) + SHA-256 at rest | n/a (bearer) | D-16, D-17 |
| Share file_id ↔ share_id mapping | **Yes** | n/a | No | n/a | Required for AAD construction |
| Revoked reason | yes (to anonymous recipient!) | n/a | No | n/a | **`D-04`** — owner-controlled string leaks |
| Filename rendered into browser DOM | (after decrypt) | n/a | n/a | n/a | `F-17` Trusted Types missing |
| Thumbnails / previews / search index | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | None exist |

## 9. Testing Gaps — prioritized

Consolidated from each slice's §6. Grouped by priority bucket. Each item maps to one or more findings; the full per-test recipe is in the slice that raised it.

### 9.1 Critical priority

1. **JWT audience claim enforcement at validator** — present a temp token to `/api/files`, expect 401/403; forge `aud=foo` with valid signature, expect rejection (`A-01`).
2. **`X-Forwarded-For` localhost-gate bypass** — off-host `curl -H "X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1"` against `/api/admin/users` and `/api/bootstrap/*`, expect 403 (`F-01`).
3. **AAD-bound chunk reorder negative test** — upload chunks 0..N successfully; swap two chunk_numbers in DB; download; expect failure **at AEAD layer**, not at end-of-file SHA-256 (`B-02`/`C-02`/`C-19`).
4. **Cross-file FEK swap** — encrypt two files with same Account-KEK; swap `encrypted_fek` blobs; expect decryption to fail (`B-08`).
5. **Bootstrap token consumed atomically on first redemption** — register first admin; re-redeem same token; expect 401/403 (`A-13`).
6. **Build reproducibility** — clean rebuild from same commit twice; `sha256sum` matches all three Go binaries (`F-05`).
7. **WASM SRI** — tamper with `libopaque.js` post-build; next browser load fails SRI check (`F-04`).

### 9.2 High priority

8. **Refusal of weak server-supplied Argon2id / chunking / password params** — Jest mock returns weak params; client refuses (`B-01`/`B-03`/`B-19`).
9. **Backup codes stored hashed not encrypted** — schema-level assertion that no `crypto.DecryptGCM(user_totp.backup_codes_encrypted)` succeeds (`A-07`).
10. **Per-user TOTP failure lockout** — 10 wrong codes for `alice` from 10 different IPs; 11th rejected with lock state (`A-08`).
11. **Race: concurrent backup-code submission** — two goroutines submit same code; exactly one succeeds (`A-16`).
12. **Per-request `IsUserJWTRevoked` enforcement** — log in; admin force-logout; replay JWT to `/api/files`; expect 401 (`A-09`).
13. **Refresh token entropy + reuse-detection** — decoded refresh token is 32 bytes; use old token after rotation triggers family-revoke + security event (`A-10`).
14. **Window.totpLoginData absent throughout login flow** — Playwright assertion (`A-04`/`F-08`).
15. **JWT in HttpOnly cookie not localStorage** — inject XSS payload that tries `localStorage.getItem('token')`; expect empty (`A-05`/`F-07`).
16. **SQL injection probe** — `storage_providers` row with `provider_id = "x' OR 1=1 --"`; `GET /api/admin/storage/sync-status`; expect parameterized error (`E-02`).
17. **Duplicate-gift idempotency** — identical `POST /api/admin/billing/gift` twice; second returns 409 once UNIQUE exists (`E-04`).
18. **Duplicate daily sweep** — `SweepAllUsers` twice across restart simulation; exactly one usage row per user per day (`E-05`).
19. **Per-route TOTP-gate verification on every `/api/admin/**`** — non-TOTP-verified JWT rejected (`E-01`, `A-01`).
20. **Padding-DoS guard** — synthetic final chunk with large `padded_size - total_size`; server memory bounded (`C-01`).
21. **Multi-provider fallback chunk-hash verify** — primary down; secondary serves; divergence detected (`C-08`).
22. **`max_accesses` enforcement under chunk-0-skip** — anonymous recipient requests chunks 1..N without 0; expect counter to advance / chunks refused (`D-01`).
23. **Race on `access_count`** — N parallel anonymous fetches against `max_accesses=1`; exactly one succeeds (`D-02`).
24. **Argon2id parameter binding into share envelope** — tamper with server's `/api/config/argon2` response; decrypt fails (`D-10`/`D-12`).
25. **CGO fuzz** — feed `auth/opaque_wrapper.c` malformed lengths, NULL pointers, oversize buffers; assert graceful refusal (`A-38`/`A-36`).

### 9.3 Medium priority

26. **DEBUG_MODE prints no raw tokens or backup codes** (`A-11`, `A-42`, `B-12`).
27. **User.Delete cascades all referencing tables** (`A-12`).
28. **Unicode-normalized usernames stored canonically** (`A-29`).
29. **TOTP `Skew = 1`** accepts codes from previous and next windows (`A-37`).
30. **`CompleteTOTPSetup` writes to replay log** (`A-20`).
31. **Lost-device TOTP recovery flow** (`A-15`).
32. **`--totp-secret` not in `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` post-mitigation** (`A-06`).
33. **`arkfile-admin readPassword` returns `[]byte` and zeroes** (`A-3`).
34. **CLI agent peer-cred check** — same-UID different-PID without `SO_PEERCRED` match rejected (`A-21`).
35. **Atomic session-file writes on initial login** — SIGKILL between write and rename (`A-43`).
36. **Browser SW path hash mismatch shows warning before disk write** — currently warns after (`C-13`).
37. **Browser Blob-fallback hash verification** — after `C-14` fix (`C-14`).
38. **6 GB on 3 GB RAM load test** — synthetic 6 GB upload; server peak heap < 1 GB (`B-27`, `C-01`).
39. **`replicateToSecondary` cancellation** — submit replication; cancel via admin runner; goroutine cooperatively exits (`C-11`).
40. **`/shared/:id` rate-limit and timing-protection coverage** (`D-05`).
41. **Free-form `revoked_reason` leak** — anonymous recipient sees only generic message (`D-04`).
42. **Negative test: invalid-base64 vs valid-base64-wrong-hash download tokens** — timing equivalence (`D-17`).
43. **Multi-instance share enumeration coherence** — when multi-instance lands (`D-18`).
44. **Anonymous-side log hygiene** — share access logs contain no plaintext username or full file_id (`D-15`/`D-25`).
45. **Ledger invariant** — `sum(credit_transactions.amount WHERE username=U) == user_credits.balance` (`E-03`/`E-04`).
46. **Overflow tests** — `ParseCreditsFromUSD("92233720369.00")`, `TickUser` with crafted `billable × rate` (`E-06`/`E-07`).
47. **`OpaqueRegister*` register-rate-limit ladder** — 20 consecutive register requests blocked by attempt 4 (`E-25`).
48. **Schema invariants** — `transaction_type` outside enum rejected; `storage_providers.provider_id` matches `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`; user delete with non-zero balance rejected (`E-21`/`E-22`/`E-23`).
49. **`/readyz` error responses contain no driver-specific wording** (`E-16`).
50. **systemd-analyze security score per unit** (`F-09`).
51. **rqlite loopback-only bind** — `ss -ltn` shows only `127.0.0.1` (`F-10`).
52. **Source-map exposure** — `GET /js/dist/app.js.map` → 404 post-fix (`F-22`).
53. **Frozen lockfile + audit** — `bun install --frozen-lockfile`; `govulncheck ./...`; `bun audit` (`F-13`/`F-25`).
54. **XSS via decrypted filename / contact-info** — Playwright; Trusted Types blocks (`F-17`).

### 9.4 Low / hygiene priority

55. Bootstrap-token redacted from journal (`F-03`).
56. Property test: `decodeBase64IfNeeded` does not corrupt valid AES-GCM ciphertext (`A-19`).
57. Backup-code modulo bias statistical test on 10^6 codes (`A-42`).
58. Cross-language Argon2id conformance test in CI (Go ↔ TS).
59. Property test: `CreateAAD` for any (share_id, file_id) pair yields unique AAD (`B-15`).
60. Empty-plaintext consistency between `EncryptGCM` and `EncryptFile` (`B-14`).
61. Fuzz test on envelope parser (`ParseEnvelope`, `DecryptFEK`).
62. Nonce-uniqueness statistical smoke test under a single key.
63. `secureWipe` on `Uint8Array` backed by `SharedArrayBuffer` (`B-21`).

## 10. Hardening Recommendations (non-vulnerability, prioritized)

Consolidated from each slice's §7. Items not tied to a specific finding but improving posture.

### 10.1 Architecture-level

1. **Separate Ed25519 keys for temp vs full JWT** — KeyManager entries `jwt_signing_key_temp_v1` and `jwt_signing_key_full_v1`. Makes A-01-class regressions structurally impossible. (A.)
2. **Typed-key wrappers in Go** — `type AccountKEK [32]byte`, `type CustomKEK [32]byte`, `type FEK [32]byte`, etc. The compiler catches misuse. Branded types in TS. (B.)
3. **Cross-language Argon2id conformance test in CI** — Go emits expected hex; TS asserts byte-equality. (B.)
4. **Embed `argon2id-params.json` / `chunking-params.json` / `password-requirements.json` into both the Go binary and the TS bundle** as compile-time floors. Remove `/api/config/*` from the security-critical path. (B/E.)
5. **Crypto agility version byte present and policed** — current envelope `0x01`; the AAD-binding fix lands as `0x02`. Parser rejects unknown versions. (B.)
6. **Soft-delete users via `deleted_at TIMESTAMP`** — preserves financial audit trail across deletes (E-21). (E.)
7. **Tamper-evident admin audit log** — append-only or chain-hashed `admin_logs` so an admin reading another user's contact info (E-18) leaves a record the admin themselves cannot tamper with. (E.)
8. **Ledger-invariant background job** — nightly verify `sum(credit_transactions.amount) == user_credits.balance` per user; alert on drift. (E.)
9. **Move bearer tokens from localStorage to `__Host-` cookies** with SameSite=Strict + CSRF double-submit. Tighten CSP; add Trusted Types. (A/F.)
10. **`require-trusted-types-for 'script'` plus refactor of all `innerHTML` sinks** — uses `textContent` or sanitized typed values. (F.)
11. **CSP/Permissions-Policy/COOP/COEP/CORP** consolidated emission in one place (Go middleware). Single source of truth per header. (F.)

### 10.2 Crypto-implementation hardening

12. **Bind AAD on every file-related AEAD** — chunks (file_id + chunk_index + chunk_count + ciphertext_sha256), FEK envelope (file_id + key_type), metadata (file_id + field_name + owner_username). Single coordinated change in Go and TS and CLI. (B/C.)
13. **Bind Argon2id params into share envelope JSON**; refuse decrypt if `m/t/p` doesn't match the local floor. (B/D.)
14. **Client-side padding before upload** — server never sees unpadded size. (B.)
15. **HKDF-Extract+Expand (instead of Expand-only)** for `KeyManager.deriveWrappingKey`. One line. (B.)
16. **TOTP backup-code length increase to 14 chars (~65 bits)**, generated without modulo bias (sample with rejection from a 32-byte buffer). (A.)
17. **Per-user TOTP failure counter + lockout on `user_totp`**. (A.)
18. **`mlock` + `MADV_DONTDUMP` + `PR_SET_DUMPABLE=0` on every server-side process** holding long-lived secrets. Match the CLI agent's pattern. (A.)
19. **Atomic write everywhere session-file is written** in both CLIs (match `atomicSaveAuthSession`). (A.)
20. **Module-private password retention in browser; never `window`-attached.** (A/F.)
21. **`mlock` and madvise on TOTP master key, OPAQUE server key, JWT key pages.** (A.)
22. **`crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` for every secret comparison** (CLI password-vs-confirm; download-token decode failure path D-17; admin reset comparisons). (A/D.)

### 10.3 Operational

23. **Document the recovery model explicitly** in `docs/security.md`: lost password = lost files; lost authenticator + lost backup codes = lost account. Discourages future "let me add an admin reset" code. (A.)
24. **Move `/healthz` and `/readyz` to a loopback listener** (or `/internal/...` with a fixed token). (E/F.)
25. **Pin Caddy binary; verify hash on every deploy.** (F.)
26. **Vendor libsodium as a pinned git submodule and statically link.** (F.)
27. **Replace MD5 with SHA-256 for SeaweedFS pinning; hash-pin rqlite.** (F.)
28. **Audit `scripts/maintenance/**` for stale assumptions** (F-19 is one example). (F.)
29. **Document the Caddy↔Arkfile co-located trust model** so `tls_insecure_skip_verify` is an auditable decision. (F.)
30. **Add `LimitCORE=0` as the FIRST hardening step on all four systemd units** — one-line change, single largest risk reduction in F-09. (F.)
31. **Document that the bootstrap-token-in-journal behavior is a known issue** and operators must invalidate by restarting service if they cannot redeem immediately. (F.)
32. **Startup self-test for `F-01`** — issue `/api/admin/users` with `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` from a non-loopback netns peer; refuse to start if it succeeds. Catches regressions deterministically. (F.)
33. **Prometheus-style metrics for billing** — ticks-per-hour, sweeps-per-day, gifts-per-day, total drained. (E.)
34. **Background incomplete-multipart-upload aborter + orphan reconciler** — closes C-06/C-07 storage-cost leaks. (C.)
35. **Pass `req.Context()` to `replicateToSecondary`** instead of `context.Background()` (or route through the task runner). (C.)
36. **`govulncheck` + `bun audit` in CI**; fail on high-severity. (F.)
37. **Cosign-sign release artifacts** with `cosign.pub` published in repo. SBOM via `syft`. (F.)
38. **Reproducible-build verification in CI** (clean rebuild × 2 matches; `strings` contains no `/home/` paths). (F.)

### 10.4 Code hygiene

39. **Delete dead code** — `crypto/session.go` (B-10), `crypto/opaque_validation.go` (B-11/A-45), `crypto/envelope.go` if comment-only (B-18), unused `storage.GetPresignedURL` (C-17), `models/file.go:CreateFile` (C-23) + `UpdatePasswordHint` (C-24), `isShareEndpoint` (D-24), unused `generateShareID` (D-23), `decodeBase64IfNeeded` rqlite-driver workaround (A-19), `scripts/maintenance/rotate-jwt-keys.sh` if obsolete (F-19).
40. **Move `crypto/envelope.go`'s envelope code into the file named `envelope.go`** rather than `file_operations.go`. (B.)
41. **Drop `//go:build mock` from chunked-upload integration tests** — they are the only end-to-end coverage and are silently skipped (C-18).
42. **Match `arkfile-admin` and `arkfile-client` interfaces** — `readPassword` signature, pipe timeout, password lifecycle. Cross-binary drift is long-term security debt. (A.)
43. **Adopt a single `requireAdmin*` helper** and migrate all admin handlers (E-10/E-13). `golangci-lint` rule forbidding inline `if !user.IsAdmin`. (E.)
44. **Adopt a parameterized-SQL-only policy** — `golangci-lint` rule banning `fmt.Sprintf` adjacent to SQL keywords (E-02). (E.)
45. **Constrain `storage_providers.provider_id` to a charset** at schema level (E-02). (E.)

## 11. Explicit Answers to `idsrp.md` §19 (20 Questions)

Each question is answered briefly with the specific finding(s) that justify the answer. Slice file:line evidence lives in the cited findings.

**1. Does the OPAQUE implementation prevent offline password guessing if the database is stolen?**
**Mostly yes for login passwords.** OPAQUE is specifically designed to resist this. `opaque_user_data` rows on their own do not enable offline guessing. Caveats: (a) if the attacker also obtains `system_keys` and ARKFILE_MASTER_KEY (Slice B `B-16`), the OPAQUE server private key is recovered, but per OPAQUE design that still does not enable offline password recovery against the user records themselves — the OPRF blinding protects passwords from the server. (b) `share_envelopes` are encrypted with **Argon2id-only** under a share password and are **trivially offline-attackable** (Slice D `D-10`), especially because share KDF parameters are not bound into the envelope (`B-19`/`D-12`).

**2. Is the OPAQUE server setup key protected separately from the database?**
**No, it is co-located.** `system_keys` row, same table as JWT signing key, TOTP master key, and bootstrap token (Slice A `A-18`). It is wrapped at rest under `ARKFILE_MASTER_KEY` which lives in `/opt/arkfile/etc/secrets.env` as an env-var-only secret (`B-16`, Slice A Open Question 1). A `system_keys` + `ARKFILE_MASTER_KEY` compromise unlocks all server-side keys at once.

**3. Is the OPAQUE export key used? If yes, how?**
**No.** libopaque returns it; both server and browser ignore it. `crypto/opaque_validation.go` is an empty stub (Slice A `A-45`, Slice B `B-11`). This is a latent capability that could be wired up for KEK derivation in the future, but doing so would require a new audit. Today the export key is dead.

**4. Is Argon2id being used safely and with domain separation?**
**Mostly.** Three contexts (account / custom / share) with distinct salt prefixes (`SHA-256("arkfile-{account,custom}-key-salt:" + username)` or random per share). Domain separation is enforced by code structure: nothing from OPAQUE feeds into Argon2id. Caveats: (a) the same Account-KEK is used both to wrap FEKs and to encrypt metadata — domain-separation omission (`B-07`); (b) parameters are server-controlled (`B-01`); (c) TS implementation blocks the main thread for several seconds (`B-04`); (d) share parameters are not bound into the envelope (`D-12`).

**5. Are Argon2id parameters attacker-controlled or downgradeable?**
**Yes.** Both Go and TS clients fetch parameters at runtime from `/api/config/argon2` with no signature, hash-pin, or compile-time floor (Slice B `B-01`). The chunking parameters and password requirements have the same defect (`B-03`, `B-19`). A compromised server can silently weaken every future KDF derivation. This is the largest single design defect in the cryptographic layer.

**6. Are file encryption keys generated randomly per file?**
**Yes.** `crypto/rand` (Go) and `crypto.getRandomValues` (TS) yield a 32-byte FEK per file. Never reused across files. Documented in Slice B §1.2.

**7. Are AEAD nonces unique under each key?**
**Yes.** All AES-GCM nonces are 12-byte random values from CSPRNG; nonce-collision is birthday-bound at 2^48 encryptions under one key, which no Arkfile file approaches. No counter-mode nonce derivation, no per-chunk-index nonce reuse. (Slice B §3.1.)

**8. Is ciphertext integrity verified before plaintext is used?**
**At the AEAD layer, yes** (AES-GCM tag verified before plaintext returned). **At the application layer, no** — see Q9. The browser streaming-download path writes plaintext to disk before the end-of-file plaintext SHA-256 is verified (`C-13`); the Blob fallback skips that verification entirely (`C-14`). A server-tampered chunk is detected, but a server-substituted chunk-of-the-same-FEK is not detected at the AEAD layer (Q9 below).

**9. Can the server swap, replay, truncate, or roll back encrypted files without detection?**
**Swap: yes, between this user's own files** (Slice B `B-02`, Slice C `C-02`). No AAD binds chunks or FEK envelopes to `file_id`, so a server with DB write access can substitute one of Alice's files' chunks for another. End-of-file plaintext SHA-256 catches this — but only after the file has been written to disk. **Reorder: yes** (`B-05`, `C-02`, `C-03`); same root cause. **Truncate: yes**; `chunk_count` is plaintext in DB and not bound by AAD. **Roll back: yes**; no monotonic counter or version chain on `file_metadata`. The end-of-file plaintext SHA-256 verification is the only line of defense, and it is post-disk-write.

**10. Are filenames and metadata encrypted, authenticated, or plaintext?**
**Filename + plaintext SHA-256: encrypted, NOT authenticated** (`B-07`, `C-19`). **File size: PLAINTEXT** to within ~10% padding (`B-06`). **Owner username: PLAINTEXT in DB and in S3 object metadata** (`C-09`). **Upload timestamp: plaintext.** **Chunk count + chunk size: plaintext** (`C-03`, `D-21`). **Password hint: plaintext by design.** **Folder path: N/A (no folders).** Slice B §3.3, Slice C §3.3, Slice D §3.3 detail the matrix; merged in §8 above.

**11. Can one user access another user's files by changing IDs?**
**No, ownership is consistently checked.** Per-route handlers query `WHERE file_id = ? AND owner_username = ?`. Exceptions: `C-12` (`GetFileEnvelope` skips `IsApproved`); `C-05` (`CancelUpload` is dead-on-arrival due to param mismatch but doesn't fail-open); admin endpoints intentionally bypass owner check by design (`E-20`).

**12. Can a malicious recipient access files after revocation?**
**Future fetches: no.** **Already-downloaded content + held keys: yes.** Revocation prevents future fetches of the envelope and chunk endpoints (cross-instance coherence is best-effort, `D-18`). Once a recipient has decrypted the envelope they hold the FEK forever; the file is not re-encrypted on revoke. The revocation UI overstates the guarantee ("immediately prevent anyone from accessing", `D-13`). This is consistent with the AGENTS.md "no PII" share posture but the UI/docs mismatch is a finding.

**13. Does sharing rely on server-controlled public keys? If so, can the server substitute keys?**
**No.** Sharing is password-derived, not PKI-based. There is no recipient public-key directory. The server cannot substitute keys directly; it can, however, substitute the entire envelope ciphertext at storage time (and the AAD-binding to `share_id + file_id` does *not* prevent this because the server controls the (share_id, file_id) mapping). Today this is mitigated by AEAD authentication of the share password the recipient types — a substituted envelope would fail to decrypt with the legitimate password. The defense is structural, not by recipient-identity verification.

**14. Can XSS expose passwords, file keys, or plaintext files?**
**Yes, all three.** Password: stashed on `window.totpLoginData` during the TOTP window (`A-04`/`F-08`). Full JWT and refresh token: in `localStorage` (`A-05`/`F-07`), exfiltrable by any same-origin script. File keys: Account-KEK is held in JS heap during file ops; sessionStorage-cached version is encrypted under an ephemeral key (`B-21`) but the wrapping key is also in JS heap, so any same-origin script can recover both. The frontend has 12 `innerHTML` sinks (`F-17`) with no Trusted Types. CSP forbids `'unsafe-inline'` in script-src (good), but a successful XSS via dependency compromise, supply-chain attack, or filename-rendering bug (filenames are decrypted client-side) reads all three.

**15. Are any secrets stored in localStorage, IndexedDB, logs, crash reports, or analytics?**
**localStorage: yes** (`A-05`/`F-07` — JWT, refresh token). **IndexedDB: no** (Slice F §3.4). **Logs: yes, in multiple places** — `A-11` (refresh token under `DEBUG_MODE=true`), `C-15`/`D-15`/`D-25` (plaintext username + file_id at INFO), `F-03` (bootstrap token in systemd journal), `E-15` (operator-supplied details in `admin_logs`). **Crash reports: no instrumentation present.** **Analytics: none.**

**16. Does password reset preserve encrypted data? If so, how?**
**N/A — there is no password reset.** Per `AGENTS.md` and Slice A §4: lost password = lost files. The cryptographic model requires the password to re-derive Account-KEK; no escrow exists. The OPAQUE export key is unused (Q3), so even a recovery flow built on it would require a new design. Consistent with the no-PII posture; should be user-facing-documented.

**17. Is the claimed security model accurately reflected in implementation and documentation?**
**Partially.** Where the design is correct, the implementation is broadly faithful. Where it isn't: (a) the "two-tier JWT" model is documented in `idsrp.md` §22.2 but not enforced (`A-01`); (b) the "mandatory TOTP for all authenticated access" claim does not hold for the admin route group (`E-01`) or for the public `/api/files/:fileId/export` header path (`E-19`); (c) the share-revocation UI overstates the guarantee (`D-13`); (d) `models/file.go`'s doc comment claims AAD-bound metadata that the implementation does not apply (`C-19`); (e) an embedded JS comment claims Argon2id parameters of 256MB/8 iterations when production is 64MB/3 (`B-09`); (f) `idsrp.md` §22.2 requires TOTP backup codes "hashed (Argon2id or comparable) and/or at-rest encrypted (never plaintext)" — Arkfile satisfies the letter but the encryption is reversible from `system_keys` + DB (`A-07`).

**18. Are CGO components reachable with attacker-controlled data?**
**Yes, by design** — the entire OPAQUE handshake feeds attacker-supplied bytes (registration request M, login credential request, etc.) through `auth/opaque_wrapper.c` into libopaque. The wrapper is 203 LOC and was line-by-line audited in Slice A. Specific issues: `A-36` (`StoreUserRecord` internal buffer inconsistency); `A-38` (password-buffer not zeroed in C heap after use). The vendored libopaque/liboprf/libsodium internals are trusted upstream and were not re-audited (per plan §2). No fuzz harness exists for the wrapper itself (testing gap §9.1 item 25).

**19. Are WASM artifacts pinned and tied to audited source?**
**No.** `client/static/js/libopaque.js` is built from source via `build-libopaque-wasm.sh` (emscripten) and checked into the repository. It is served as a static asset with **no Subresource Integrity** attribute (Slice F `F-04`) and **no hash entry in `config/dependency-hashes.json`**. There is no SRI declared in `index.html`, no build-time hash emission, and no startup self-check that the on-disk artifact matches the audited source. A build-host or asset-CDN compromise can substitute the WASM with no integrity check downstream.

**20. What are the top five security risks in the current design?**
1. **`F-01` Critical** — `X-Forwarded-For` localhost-gate bypass renders admin and bootstrap localhost-only protections remotely bypassable.
2. **`A-01` Critical** — Two-tier JWT model is not enforced; post-OPAQUE temp token reaches every protected route, making the "mandatory TOTP" claim cosmetic.
3. **`B-02` / `C-02` / `C-19` / `B-08` (High, cross-slice)** — No AAD binds file chunks, FEK envelopes, or metadata to file identity or order; an active server can swap/reorder/substitute undetected at AEAD layer.
4. **`A-07` + `A-17` + `A-18` (High, cross-slice)** — TOTP backup codes encrypted not hashed; master key co-located with every other server secret; a `system_keys` + DB + master-key compromise yields plaintext backup codes for every user.
5. **`A-05` + `F-07` + `A-04` + `F-08` (High, cross-slice)** — Full JWT, refresh token, and (briefly) plaintext password all reachable via same-origin script. Any XSS / dependency compromise yields complete account takeover.

## 12. Open Questions for the Team

Consolidated from `00-plan.md` §10 and each slice's §5. Items marked "Answered" in the plan are not repeated.

### 12.1 Pre-Slice-A questions (status from `00-plan.md` §10)

1. **Forgotten-password recovery intentionally absent?** Still TBD by developer confirmation. Slice A treats it as N/A by design (`A-15` documents the impossibility of TOTP recovery). Recommendation: document it explicitly in `docs/security.md` so future contributors do not implement an admin reset that would weaken the model.
2. **Device-management / per-device session listing planned?** Still TBD. Refresh tokens are not tied to a device identifier today; building this requires schema additions to `refresh_tokens`. Slice A flagged as N/A for now.
3. **CSP strictness target for production?** F-14 / F-15 / F-17 surface specific items. Recommendation: add `require-trusted-types-for 'script'`, remove inline `onclick=` handlers, refactor `innerHTML` sinks to `textContent`.
4. **WASM bundled into TS build or fetched separately?** Currently fetched separately (`<script src="/js/libopaque.js">`) per Slice F §1.2. F-04 escalates if it remains separate without SRI; consider bundling or hash-pinning.

### 12.2 Slice A open questions

5. **`KeyManager` at-rest encryption posture** — confirm `system_keys` rows are encrypted at rest under a KEK and that the KEK lives outside the rqlite volume. Per `.clinerules` the auditor cannot read `/opt/arkfile/etc/**`. Determines final severity of A-18.
6. **Caddyfile trusted-proxy configuration** — answered partially by Slice F: `Caddyfile.prod` and `Caddyfile.test` do not declare `trusted_proxies` and do not strip incoming `X-Forwarded-For`. Severity escalation to `F-01` Critical now applies. Fix per §10.3 item 32.
7. **JWT TTL default** — `utils.GetJWTTokenLifetime()` default and env-var override not confirmed; if hours, A-09's gap widens.
8. **CLI agent + refresh-token rotation** — confirmed behavior: agent wipes on session-hash mismatch. Open question: should `refreshSessionToken` push a new hash to the agent rather than force re-login?
9. **`utils.IsProductionEnvironment` definition** — Slice F confirms it is env-var-checked (`ENVIRONMENT=production`). A-14/A-41 stand. Recommendation: build-tag separation instead.
10. **TOTP master-key rotation script absent** — Slice A Open Q6. Recommendation: implement `scripts/maintenance/rotate-totp-keys.sh` to re-derive every user's encrypted blob under the new master key in a single transaction.
11. **`config/security_config.go` fail-closed on conflicting flags** — does it refuse to start if `ENVIRONMENT=production` AND `ADMIN_DEV_TEST_API_ENABLED=true`? A-14 should fail-closed.
12. **`arkfile-admin` pipe-mode timeout** — missing vs `arkfile-client`'s 10s. Justified? If so, what use case?
13. **Browser TOTP-setup screen lifetime** — after "Done", is the section's `innerHTML` cleared or just hidden? A-22 assumes the worst.
14. **`/api/admin-contacts` exposure** — public unauthenticated route returning admin contact info. Intentional? Cross-ref A-24 admin enumeration.

### 12.3 Slice B open questions

15. **Is the decision not to bind `file_id` into file-chunk AEAD documented anywhere?** Slice B treats B-02 as a finding; if there's a design rationale, please flag.
16. **Planned key-rotation cadence for system keys?** B-25 `REPLACE INTO` suggests no rotation today.
17. **Is `ARKFILE_MASTER_KEY` ever read from anywhere other than `secrets.env`?** Per `.clinerules` the auditor has not read that file.
18. **Should Arkfile bundle Argon2id WASM (vs continuing with pure-JS `@noble/hashes`)?** Would address B-04. Requires SRI/pinning treatment in Slice F.
19. **Is the 5 GB client-side `MAX_FILE_SIZE` intentional?** Conflicts with AGENTS.md 6 GB mobile constraint (B-27).
20. **Roadmap to derive a separate metadata key via HKDF from Account-KEK?** Would resolve B-07.

### 12.4 Slice C open questions

21. **Schema details deferred to Slice E** — resolved by Slice E §3.3.
22. **`ADMIN_DEV_TEST_API_ENABLED=true` cannot be set in prod-deploy?** Per `.clinerules` the auditor cannot read secrets. Slice F item §5.4 also asks. Recommendation: `prod-deploy.sh` should refuse to write the flag.
23. **CLI parity for AAD changes** — implementing C-02 needs matching changes in `cmd/arkfile-client/crypto_utils.go`. Mirror in TS.
24. **`docs/wip/folders-multi-upload-v2.md`** — out of scope for slices; explains C-19 doc-vs-code drift. Did the team roll back AAD or is it just unimplemented?
25. **`ENABLE_UPLOAD_REPLICATION` default in production?** Determines C-08 urgency.
26. **`storage.GetPresignedURL` planned use case?** If not, delete (C-17).

### 12.5 Slice D open questions

27. **`max_accesses` intended semantic** — "completed downloads, total" or "download starts"? Determines D-01/D-02 severity.
28. **`BASE_URL` mandatory in production?** D-09 assumes the Origin fallback path is reachable.
29. **Daily EntityID rotation period configurable?** D-11/D-19.
30. **Is `generateShareID` intentional (CLI client) or stray?** D-23.
31. **Per-share-creation rate limiting** — any account-level quota/spam-share guard? Not visible in this slice.

### 12.6 Slice E open questions

32. **Confirm no JWT minted with `aud=arkfile-prod` + `totp_verified=false`** — if any path exists (e.g. refresh after TOTP reset), E-01 and E-19 escalate.
33. **Caddy `X-Forwarded-For` posture** — Slice F confirms `F-01`; E-14 now Critical-escalated.
34. **Future paid-top-up `transaction_id` source** — Stripe `pi_*` IDs, crypto txid, etc. Add `UNIQUE(transaction_id)` *before* writing any paid rows.
35. **`AdminCleanupTestUser`'s duplicate `opaque_user_data` row (E-11)** — intentional belt-and-suspenders, or copy-paste bug?
36. **Process-local `lastSweepDate` (E-05)** — documented invariant or emergent property?
37. **`AdminGetContactInfo` audit-log** — should every admin read land in `admin_logs`? (E-18.)

### 12.7 Slice F open questions

38. **Runtime file modes under `/opt/arkfile/etc/**`** — `prod-deploy.sh` writes `secrets.env` as 0640 and `caddy-env` as 0600; confirm at runtime that no operator chmod has loosened these. Per `.clinerules`.
39. **`bun.lock` commit status** — confirm `git ls-files client/static/js/bun.lock` returns a hit; if not, F-13 escalates.
40. **`scripts/maintenance/rotate-jwt-keys.sh` retirement** — confirm with Slice A's owner that the on-disk path is no longer authoritative.
41. **`ENVIRONMENT=production` posture today** — recommended that all non-dev deploys write this unconditionally so `ValidateProductionConfig`'s fail-closed abort is enforced.
42. **Release-artifact signing today** — F-05 assumes none; confirm there is no out-of-band CI signing process before recommending cosign integration.
43. **`AllowedOrigins` in deployed CORS config** — with `AllowCredentials: true`, `[*]` would break the app; confirm explicit allow-list.
44. **`/healthz` and `/readyz` external monitoring** — decide before moving to loopback (F-20).
45. **Caddy binary supply-chain pinning** — `prod-deploy.sh` Caddy download step not deep-read; confirm specific release hash is pinned.

## 13. Out-of-Scope Reminders (for completeness)

Per `00-plan.md` §9, the following remain out of scope for this review:

- Re-auditing libsodium / liboprf / libopaque internals (trusted upstream; only the CGO boundary in `auth/opaque_wrapper.c` was line-by-line audited).
- Performance benchmarking.
- Penetration testing of any live deployment (`test.arkfile.net` or otherwise).
- Reading `.env` files or `/opt/arkfile/etc/**` (per `.clinerules`).
- Committing or pushing any change. Developers commit. This document is also produced under that constraint.

---

## 14. Closing Assessment

Arkfile's design is good: OPAQUE for authentication, client-side AEAD for content, Argon2id for password-derived KEKs, password-derived share envelopes, no PII / no IPs in logs. The primitives are right and the trust boundaries are mostly placed where they should be.

The implementation does not yet meet the design's claims in several places that matter materially. The two highest-leverage fixes are not large — `e.IPExtractor` and JWT audience enforcement are each a few lines of code — and together they close the headline Critical/High pathway: a remote, unauthenticated attacker plus password compromise yields full account access today; with those two fixes that pathway closes. The next layer of work — AAD on every AEAD operation, parameter floors embedded in client bundles, schema-level financial-audit integrity, supply-chain hardening — is more substantial but each item is well-scoped and individually addressable.

There are no findings in this review that require fundamental architectural change. Every finding is fixable within the existing structure; the greenfield posture (`AGENTS.md` §"Greenfield App") means there is no backwards-compatibility friction to absorb. The 10-step fix campaign in §1.5 closes roughly 1 Critical, 12 High, and ~20 Medium findings.

Beta deployment at `test.arkfile.net` should expect that, until at least `F-01`, `A-01`, and the AAD-binding cluster (`B-02` / `C-02` / `C-19`) are addressed, file-content confidentiality against a protocol-following server holds, but file-content authenticity against an active server and admin-surface remote isolation do not. Operators should be informed.

The system is on a credible path to delivering its stated guarantees. The work to get there is concrete, well-bounded, and described finding-by-finding in the six slice documents that this synthesis summarizes.

## End of Slice G — Executive Synthesis
